Blank Framework Theme
============================

A blank, simple theme framework for SilverStripe. This can be downloaded and
used to build more complex, bespoke themes while removing some of the more
tedious parts of setting up a new theme.

Basic framework CSS selectors are included to allow for quicker writing of clean
CSS.

*NOTE* This is not a usable theme, it is only designed to allow you to more
quickly develop your own themes.
